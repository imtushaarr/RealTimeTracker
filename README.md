# Real Time Tracker App

![REAL TIME TRACKER APP](https://github.com/imtushaarr/RealTimeTracker/assets/92511269/aaee6331-1047-429e-9db4-f0eb8c306130)


The Real-Time Location Tracker is a web application built with React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and Leaflet. It enables real-time tracking of users’ locations on an interactive map. Users can see their own and others’ live locations as markers on the map, facilitating easy monitoring and coordination.

## Features

**Real-Time Location Updates:** Users can share their current location, and the map updates in real-time to display their movements.
**Interactive Map:** Utilizes Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library, to provide a responsive and interactive map interface.
**Geolocation API:** Integrates with the browser’s Geolocation API to fetch users’ current coordinates accurately.
**Socket.io Integration:** Enables seamless real-time communication between the server and clients, ensuring instant updates of location data.

## Technologies Used

**Frontend:**
- React.js
- Leaflet (for maps)
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js (for server-side routing and middleware)
- Socket.io (for real-time WebSocket communication)

**Other Tools**
- Git & GitHub (for version control and repository management)
- VS Code (as the integrated development environment)
